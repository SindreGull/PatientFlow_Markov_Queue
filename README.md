# PatientFlow_Markov_Queue
This project explores the use of queueing theory and Markov processes to model an urgent care clinic using an M/M/1 queue, with extensions to priority based patients. It was developed as part of a coursework project in Spring 2022.


## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- M/M/1 queue modeling and assumptions  
- Derivation of expected wait times using Littleâ€™s Law 
- Separate analysis for urgent vs. normal patients  
- Markov chains and birth-death processes* 
- Derivation and plotting of waiting time as a function of urgency level 
- Analytical expressions for waiting time as a function of arrival rate and service time  
- Monte Carlo simulations to validate analytical results


## Note

The original R code used for simulations has unfortunately been lost. However, the report includes detailed descriptions of the theory, methodology and results, as well as several visualizations of queue behavior and statistical outputs.
